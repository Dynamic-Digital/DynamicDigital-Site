Hacker Gary Bowser has agreed to pay $10 million to settle the piracy charges Nintendo have levied against him in a recent lawsuit. Bowser is a member of the Team Xecuter group who have created mods for and jailbroken the Nintendo Switch, 3DS, NES Classic and other consoles.

Xecuter's best known product is the SX Pro which allows Nintendo Switch users to play pirated games on the console. Nintendo has been chasing hackers for years. Bowser was arrested and indicted for a separate federal case relating to Nintendo Switch hacks last year and ordered to pay $4.5 million. He has paid Nintendo a total of $14.5 million in restitution.

Bowser, and many others, have made a business out of selling hacks and mods for consoles. This is not only controversial in standard law but is also controversial within the modding and emulation community as they tend to focus on open-source efforts that avoid federal authorities.
