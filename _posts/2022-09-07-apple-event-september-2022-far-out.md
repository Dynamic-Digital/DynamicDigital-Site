#﻿# Event Overview and Preamble

Earlier today, Apple announced their latest lineup of phones, Airpods, and Apple Watch. The new devices are the latest in Apple's lineup and as a consequence are also the most powerful devices in their respected lineups.

A﻿s Tim Cook puts this he said they want the devices to feel personal to you and that they are the only ones who can make devices with a combination of software and hardware that works this well, they clearly forgot that Google has also started to do this as well.

#﻿## Saving People's Lives

Apple Watches have saved many people's lives because without it many people would have had no idea that they were about to have a heart attack and they also wouldn't have been able to contact emergency services when they needed too.

#﻿## Apple Watch Series 8

#﻿### New Features

Apple have included a new temperature sensor in the Series 8, they are pitching this as a major new way for women to understand their cycles. They have two new sensors, one under the bottom crystal and one under the display. They also say that the new devices will allow for users to understand if they may be feeling ill and if should see a doctor.

Series 8 also includes a new Crash Detection feature which will allow for people to automatically alert their families when they are unable to do it themselves. This is done using a new gyroscope to understand how the device is moving, the system will also wait for around 10 seconds before calling the emergency services.

Series 8 also has a new low power mode which will enable 36 hours of battery life compared to the standard 18 hours which is provided, Apple says that this is "all-day" battery life but this is up for debate in my eyes as 18 hours is not 24 hours which is commonly regarded as a full day.

Series 8 also includes a standard ECG, Heart Rate, and Blood Oxygen sensor enabling people to keep on top of their health. It will start at $399 for GPS and $499 for the LTE model.

#﻿## Apple Watch Ultra

The Apple Watch Ultra has the same screen and shape as the Series 8 but it does include a new button, known as the action button, and 36 hours of battery life with 60 hours of extended battery life. All Apple Watch Ultra devices also include LTE connectivity allowing you to make calls from your watch. The new GPS chip also allows people to use L1 and L5 tracking to ensure better accuracy.

Apple also say that there is a new orienteering view which will allow for you to view waypoints on your watch, there is also an 80db siren for when you are off grid. It's also apparently great for people doing watersports such as scuba diving and is able to withstand up to 130 feet.

It will cost $799 dollars for all models and launches on September 23rd.
