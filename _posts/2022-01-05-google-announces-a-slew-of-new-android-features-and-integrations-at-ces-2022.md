Google has announced major new features coming to Android, Chromebooks, Wearables and more during 2022. These were announced during CES 2022 in a blog post after Google pulled their physical presence due to concerns over COVID-19.

## Android and other Google Devices

Google has officially announced that fast pair, Google's process for quickly setting up and connecting new devices, is officially coming to Chrome OS devices over the next few weeks. This will allow Chromebooks to easily detect and setup new devices with less hassle and less effort than what was previously required with setting up Bluetooth devices. They also announced that starting later this year people will be able to use their android device to set up a new Chromebook. This process will automatically transfer your Wi-Fi passwords and Google credentials in an effort to make the setup process easier for new users.
