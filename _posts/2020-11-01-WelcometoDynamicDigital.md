# Hello World

<img src="\assets\Images\DynamicDigitalCombinedLogos.jpg" style="float: left; width: 30%; padding-right: 5%"> Today I am pleased to say that the redesign of the Dynamic Digital website has been completed. This redesign will allow us to get new stories to readers quicker and allow readers to enjoy more of the news they love.

As always we still have our podcasts on spotify that people can listen to anytime they want free of charge. I normally release one or two episodes a week depending on what's going on in terms of a new console release (Next week on November 10th we have a review of the series x coming, stay tuned.) Sometimes I also do a joint episode with Matt so we can talk about the latest technology news in the world and viewers can also get a perspective thats different to my own and form their own opinions using both of our perspectives and multiple points of view.
