Microsoft have finally released a native OneDrive sync app for Arm devices, allowing these devices to experience native sync speeds. The app is available as an opt-in download on both Windows on Arm and MacOS devices.

With this update the process will no longer be emulated as a 32-bit application and will instead run as a 64-bit application for Windows on Arm users. This should mean that users with large files or lots of files can expect improved performance across their device.

Microsoft has not revealed a release date for the Application but they have said that anyone can enable it from the "get OneDrive Insider preview updates before release" toggle in OneDrive settings.
