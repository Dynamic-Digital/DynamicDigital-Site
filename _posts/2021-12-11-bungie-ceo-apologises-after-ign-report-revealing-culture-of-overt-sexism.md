![In a new report released by IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-report-battle-soul-work-culture-harassment-crunch), it has been revealed that there have been multiple instances of sexism and workplace toxicity at Bungie. More specifically the studio was described as an "overt sexism boys' club culture" with multiple stories of "microaggressions, systemic inequalities, and difficulties in being heard". This is the latest in a string of accusations that have plagued the gaming industry recently in regards to discrimination.

According to IGN, people at the Studio have had to deal with extremely toxic management, sexism, and more.
