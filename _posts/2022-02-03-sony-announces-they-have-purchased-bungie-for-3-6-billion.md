Sony have announced that they have purchased Bungie, developers of Halo, for $3.6 billion. This acquisition comes a week after Microsoft announced their intent to buy Activision Blizzard and a year after Microsoft purchased Zenimax Media. However, unlike those acquisitions Sony doesn't appear to be trying to gain exclusives and instead are trying to get into the live service gaming model that has since tremendous success in recent years
