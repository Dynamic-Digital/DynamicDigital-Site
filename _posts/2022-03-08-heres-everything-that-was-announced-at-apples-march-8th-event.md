On the March 8th, 2022, Apple held their "peak performance" event where they officially announced the new iPad Air, Mac Studio, iPhone SE, and Apple Studio Display. They also announced... The event was pre-recorded due to the Covid-19 Pandemic


## iPad Air

The new iPad Air 5 includes the M1 Processor, 5G calling capabilities, and Centre Stage support. Camera improvements also include 1080p video recording, as well as standard and ultra-wide-angle lenses like the iPhone 13.

## Mac Studio

The Mac Studio's design is based on the Mac Mini, but that's where the similarities end. The Mac Studio is powered by the M1 Max, the same Apple Silicon that powers the higher end MacBook Pro.

This anyone who has been looking for a way into the MacOS ecosystem but doesn't want to buy an iMac or MacBook and was also underwhelmed by the power of the M1 Model Mac Mini to get into the Apple Ecosystem with a device as powerful as the MacBook Pro whilst still using an external monitor instead of having a built-in monitor that they have to use.

## Apple Studio Display

The Apple Studio Display is a remarkably interesting new device from Apple. It includes an A13 bionic chip and runs iOS by default. This is a massive change by Apple as we have previously only seen iOS running on mobile devices such as the iPhone and iPad. The display is also able to be used as an external monitor by devices such as the Mac Studio.

The monitor has a 27-inch display and slightly larger bezels than the Pro Display XDR.
