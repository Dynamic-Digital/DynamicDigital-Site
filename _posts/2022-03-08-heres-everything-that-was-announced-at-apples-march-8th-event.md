The iPhone SE now comes with a 12-megapixel Wide camera and includes support for smart HDR 4.



The iPhone SE has a starting price of $429 in the US.



## iPad Air

The new iPad Air 5 includes the M1 Processor, 5G calling capabilities, and Centre Stage support. Camera improvements also include 1080p video recording, as well as standard and ultra-wide-angle lenses like the iPhone 13.

The new M1 processor brings the performance of the iPad Pro to the iPad Air series. Apple claims to have increased performance by up to 60% and claims that it's two times faster than the best-selling windows device in its price class.

The front facing camera is now a 12-megapixel Ultra-Wide that supports center stage for the first time. This means that all iPads now support centre stage. The 12MP Wide camera on the back also allows the iPad air to take sharp photos and 4K videos.

The new iPad Air starts at $599 with 64GB and 128GB storage configurations.

## M1 Ultra

The new M1 Ultra includes 20 CPU cores with sixteen high-performance cores and four high-efficiency cores as well as 64 GPU cores. They have also managed to create a new Interconnect technology allowing the devices to connect two M1 Max SoCs together with low-latency and increased memory bandwidth. The M1 Ultra supports up to 128GB of unified memory. The new device also takes advantage of the same battery consumption optimisations as previous devices.

The M1 Ultra appears as a single processor to applications meaning that applications have no idea that it is working with two processors that are interconnected. This will allow developers to instantly take advantage of the new processor without having to rewrite their code as they would on devices that use two processors on one motherboard

## Mac Studio

The Mac Studio's design is based on the Mac Mini, but that's where the similarities end. The Mac Studio is powered by the M1 Ultra, the new chip includes 20 CPU cores and 64 GPU cores allowing for some of the most powerful devices ever to be brought into the studios that designers and developers work in every day.

This is for anyone who has been looking for a way into the MacOS ecosystem but doesn't want to buy an iMac or MacBook and was also underwhelmed by the power of the M1 Model Mac Mini to get into the Apple Ecosystem with a device as powerful as the MacBook Pro whilst still using an external monitor instead of having a built-in monitor.

The exterior has a width of 7.7 inches allowing the device to take up minimal space while allowing for the device to take up a small amount of space on the desk. The Mac Studio includes WIFI 6 and Bluetooth 5, as well as up to 4 Pro Display XDRs.

### Mac Studio with M1 Max

The new Mac Studio is 50% faster than the top end Mac Pro in CPU Performance and 60% faster than the most popular Mac Pro GPU. This is also 3.4x faster than the fastest 27-inch iMac.

The Mac Studio with M1 Max starts at $1999

### Mac Studio with M1 Ultra

The new Mac Studio is 90% faster than the Mac Pro with 16-cores and is 60% faster than a 20-core Mac Pro. It's also 80% faster than the Top-End Mac Pro in GPU performance.

The Apple Studio Display is a remarkably interesting new device from Apple. It includes an A13 bionic chip. This is a massive change by Apple as we have previously only seen iOS running on mobile devices such as the iPhone and iPad. The display is also able to be used as an external monitor by devices such as the Mac Studio.

The monitor has a 27-inch, 5K retina display and slightly larger bezels than the Pro Display XDR. The stand includes a 30-degree tilt, but this can change depending on the stand that is chosen. The display includes True Tone as well.

The Studio Display also has a 12-megapixel camera with center stage and a three-mic array for video calls. There is also a 6-speaker system which supports spatial audio and includes support for Dolby Atmos.

The Studio Display has three USB-C ports and one Thunderbolt-4 Port allowing the device to be connected to any thunderbolt enable Mac and pass through all the devices that are connected to the display itself.

The Apple Studio display starts at $1599
