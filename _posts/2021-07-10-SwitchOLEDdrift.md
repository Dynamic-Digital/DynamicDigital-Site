Last week, Nintendo announced a [new model of the Nintedo switch](/2021/07/06/OLEDSWITCH.html) called the Nintendo Switch (OLED model). This new model didn't include the new cpu or 1080p display that people have been asking for. however, it did include a bigger OLED screen which is nice... I guess.

However, the biggest issue with this is that throughout the entire announcement post they never mentioned the Joy-Cons, the only information we have is that the previous Joy-Cons are compatible with the new Switch and vice versa. In fact the only direct quote we have regarding the Joy-Cons is that "The Joy-Con controllers included with Nintendo Switch (OLED model) are the same as the controllers currently available." This implies that Nintendo have made no changes to the Joy-Cons including to fix the current Joy-Con drift issue that has plagued the Nintendo Switch since it's release.

in a statement to the Verge Nintendo said "We are aware of reports that some Joy-Con controllers have not responded correctly," this is also the language that Nintendo used when they instructed customer service reps to fix Joy-Con drift issues for free.

Here is Nintendo's full statement to The Verge on the matter:

> The Joy-Con controller configuration and functionality did not change with Nintendo Switch (OLED model). The configuration and functionally is the same as that of the Joy-con controllers for the Nintendo Switch console. At Nintendo, we take great pride in creating quality products and we are continuously making improvements to them. We are aware of reports that some Joy-Con controllers have not responded correctly. We want our consumers to have fun with Nintendo Switch, and if anything falls short of this goal we always encourage them to visit http://support.nintendo.com so we can help.
