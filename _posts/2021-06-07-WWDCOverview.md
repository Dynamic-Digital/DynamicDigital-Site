Apple just finished their WWDC keynote and as usual we have heard about all of their newest updates coming to all of their platforms later this year. However, this year there was a shadow over the event because of their recent trial against Epic where they showed that they believe that developers contribute no value to Apple's products and that instead they are being generous to let people build apps for their devices.

Firstly, let's go over what Apple announced during their keynote today.



# iOS 15

    > Focus is designed to allow users to use certain apps at certain times and block notifications from apps during certain times and also change the home screen layout 
 
- Shared with you

    > Apple have now announced that lots of their apps will include a specific shared with you section so you can see whats been shared with you easily

- Notification Summary

    > Notification Summary allows you to block notifications from apps that send you lots of useless notifications throughout the day

All of these features are also available in iPadOS 15 and Focus is available in MacOS Monterey

- New Notes experience: shared notes, notifications for mentions, quick notes; aware of app being used

     > The notes app is now able to be used for shared notes and when you mention a specific user they will recieve a notification so they know to go and check that note. Apple have also announced quick notes for iPad and MacOS which allows users to make quick notes in all of their apps and the quick notes are able to see what app is being used and this can even work with 3rd party apps.

- Swift Playgrounds: develop apps, code completion, test apps in full screen

    > In swift playgrounds on iOS all users can now use Swift Playgrounds to develop and test apps for iPadOS and iOS and even distribute those apps on the app store straight from their iPad, these projects can also be modified on xcode for MacOS as well.
