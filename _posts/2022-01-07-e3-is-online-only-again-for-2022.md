E3 2022 has officially been cancelled as an in-person event following the latest surge of Covid-19 cases. This was originally reported by [VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/2022/01/06/e3-shifts-to-online-only-event-because-of-omicron-concerns/) and marks the third year year in a row that E3 has skipped an in-person event.

In a statement to VentureBeat an ESA representative said, "Due to the ongoing health risks surrounding COVID-19 and its potential impact on the safety of exhibitors and attendees, E3 will not be held in person in 2022, we are nonetheless excited about the future of E3 and look forward to announcing more details soon."

The ESA had said in April 2021 that they would be holding their 2022 event in person but it appears that they have change their plans due to the increase in COVID cases around the US. It appears as though the ESA didn't want to follow in the steps of the CTA and keep their plans for an in-person event whilst risking the possibility of their biggest attendees pulling out from the show as well as the media. This marks the latest in a series of events that have been cancelled or made online-only after the recent omicron COVID strain.
