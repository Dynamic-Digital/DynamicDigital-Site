On January 18th 2022, Microsoft announced that they intend to buy Activision Blizzard, the makers of Call of Duty, Overwatch, and Diablo, for $68.7 billion. This means that Microsoft will be the third largest gaming company by revenue behind Sony and Tencent. This will allow Microsoft to increase their first-party games and also increase the games available to Game Pass subscribers.

However, this deal also comes amidst major controversy surrounding the treatment of employees at Activision Blizzard King and calls for CEO Bobby Kotick to resign from the company. This means that people will be watching how Microsoft handle these issues very closely. Another issue is that regulators will be heavily scrutinising the deal as this is the biggest deal in gaming history.

Let's take a better look at what this deal may entail.
