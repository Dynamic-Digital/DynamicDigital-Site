On June 24th Microsoft announced that Windows 11 will come with support for running Android apps out of the box. This is great news on it's own but lots of people were wondering whether or not sideloading apks from sources other than the Amazon AppStore that's built into the Windows Store but now it seems that our wishes have been granted because Miguel de icaza, a software engineer at Microsoft, has announced on twitter that sideloading Android apps will be possible.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" data-theme="dark"><p lang="und" dir="ltr">Yes!</p>&mdash; Miguel de Icaza (@migueldeicaza) <a href="https://twitter.com/migueldeicaza/status/1408222245265330178?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 25, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The tweet above confirms that Android app sideloading will be available in Windows 11, whether or not this feature will be available in the first insider preview build that releases next week is yet to be seen.
