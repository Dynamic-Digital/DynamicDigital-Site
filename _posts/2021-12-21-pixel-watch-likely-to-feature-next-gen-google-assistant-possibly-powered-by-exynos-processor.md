[According to 9to5Google](https://9to5google.com/2021/12/21/pixel-watch-next-gen-google-assistant-wear-os-exynos/), new links within the latest Google app revealed mentions to a "PIXEL_EXPERIENCE_WATCH" which is similar to tags related to other pixel products, suggesting that Google's first smartwatch will feature the pixel branding and may also have features not available on other Wear OS watches.

There are also links to a "next-generation assistant " which has been available on Pixel devices since the Google Pixel 4. 9to5Google found references to "Rohan", which is reported by [Front Page Tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT6Y-u1Q9_c) and [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/google-pixel-watch-rohan-android-smartwatch-development-fitbit-launch-2021-12) to be a codename for the Pixel Watch.

This is all just a rumour so take this with a pinch of salt but if it is true then it could show a major reinvestment in Google's smartwatch plans.
