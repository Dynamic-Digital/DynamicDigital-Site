## Galaxy Unpacked

Samsung held their Galaxy Unpacked presentation on 11th August 2021 and they announced a lot of new devices. They announced 2 new foldables, the Z Flip3 and the Z Fold3, the Galaxy Watch4 series, the first wearables being released with Wear OS 3, and the Galaxy Buds 2, an upgrade over the Galaxy Buds+ which now includes Active Noise Cancelling and Ambient Sound.

Let's get into what these new devices include and whether they are worth the money.

This is quite possibly the best foldable we have seen so far since Samsung released the first Galaxy Fold. The new Galaxy Z Fold3 has an IPX8 water resistance rating which makes it the first foldable device to include water resistance.

It also includes S Pen support for the first time ever allowing users to draw on the screen of the Fold 3 allowing people to draw on a whiteboard in Microsoft Teams and make notes in a more natural way then before.

There is also an under display camera on the interior display which allows for a more natural viewing experience when it's not in use while it still allows the camera to see clearly when it needs to by deactivating the pixels that cover the camera allowing it to get a clear view of what's in front of it.

The front display on the device is basically the same as it was on the Z Flip2 with the exception of it being capable of a 120hz refresh rate which makes animations on the device feel much smoother.

It comes with a snapdragon 888 processor, 12GB of RAM and 256GB or 512GB storage options. It starts at a price of £1,499.99 in the UK and $1799.99 in the US.

The biggest change between Galaxy Z Flip and Z Flip3 is the larger screen on the front of the device allowing users to see notifications and even reply to them without having to open their device.

It comes with a snapdragon 888 processor, 8GB of RAM and 128GB or 256GB storage options. It starts at a price of £949.00 in the UK and $999.99 in the US.

## Galaxy Watch4 Series

The Galaxy Watch4 and Galaxy Watch4 classic have mostly identical features with the biggest difference between them being the physical rotating bezel on the Galaxy Watch4 Classic edition meanwhile the standard Galaxy Watch4 has a digital touch bezel like the Galaxy Watch Active.

These new Galaxy Watches are the first devices to use the new Google Wear OS 3 out of the box, this new OS combines Samsung's Tizen OS with Google's Wear OS allowing developers to code for a single platform that works across more devices then before.

The Galaxy Watch4 series also includes a brand new 3-in-1 BioActive Sensor, this sensor combines Heart Rate, Blood Pressure and ECG as well as body composition. The measurement of body composition (BIA) is the only new sensor that was announced. BIA measurement allows users to measure body fat percentage, skeletal muscle, body water and more using just two fingers in 15 seconds at any time.
