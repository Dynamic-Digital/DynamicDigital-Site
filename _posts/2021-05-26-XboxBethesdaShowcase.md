Microsoft has officially announced that they are holding their E3 showcase on Sunday, June 13th at 6pm BST. This is going to be their first games showcase since acquiring Bethesda in March of this year and it should be interesting to see what they will be announcing. Xbox shared the news on their Twitter Account.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">‚è∞ June 13th, 6pm BST<br>üó£Ô∏è Games, Games, Games<br>üé¨ World Premieres<br>‚ö°Ô∏è New titles on <a href="https://twitter.com/XboxGamePassUK?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@XboxGamePassUK</a><br><br>Save the date for the Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase | <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/XboxBethesda?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#XboxBethesda</a></p>&mdash; Xbox UK (@xboxuk) <a href="https://twitter.com/xboxuk/status/1397629124836044802?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 26, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

In the announcement they said that they would be sharing news regarding Xbox game pass, Games and also some new world premieres. This years E3 is meant to be a massive showcase of Games for Xbox, especially when considering the massive drought of news we've had regarding first party titles from Xbox Games Studios in the last few years. I'll be following this story closely and will release another story and an update to this story on the day of the showcase or soon after going over all the details that are shared by Xbox and Bethesda on June 13th.

As you can see in the image above, it seems that we can expect to hear more about Halo Infinite and Starfield in this showcase. This can be seen from how Earth is at the top half and the planet from the Starfield teasers in the lower half.

Halo Infinite is confirmed to be a Xbox and PC exclusive and Starfield is rumoured to be the first Xbox exclusive from Bethesda since Microsoft acquired the company.
