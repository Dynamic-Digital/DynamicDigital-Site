After purchasing CloudReady developer Neverware in December 2020, Google have officially announced that Cloudready is becoming Chrome OS flex and has launched in Early Access today. The new offering will be officially supported by Google and freely available to consumers.

The new version of Chrome OS integrates "the benefits of CloudReady into a new version of Chrome OS". Available features include the Chrome browser, Nearby Sharing, cross-device functions with android, cloud sync, and Google Assistant as well as Family Link and Smart Lock. Newer devices may support Linux but there are no plans to add Play Store support to Chrome OS.

Much like many Linux distros today, Chrome OS Flex can be tried from a USB Stick first before being fully installed on someone's device which would allow users to make sure that they are sure they want to go ahead with installing the operating system. It works on any Intel or AMD Mac or Windows PC, but it doesn't support ARM meaning that users of Apple Silicon devices are left out for now.

Chrome OS Flex is available in Early Access today in the dev channel. A stable version will be released in the future and CloudReady users will be able to upgrade when it is released
