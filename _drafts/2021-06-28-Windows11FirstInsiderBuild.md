## The new Store

The new Windows Store has a much nicer design, it works faster then the old design and even includes traditional Windows apps. This is the biggest change to the store since it's introduction in Windows 10 and with their new revenue share policies, allowing developers to keep all of the money their app makes as long as they bring their own payment platform, it should start to put pressure on Apple and Google to start doing the same. Especially as it now sets a precedent for companies allowing developers to use their own payment platforms and keep all of their revenue.
