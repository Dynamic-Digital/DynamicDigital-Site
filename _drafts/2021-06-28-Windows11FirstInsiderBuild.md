## The new Store

The new Windows Store has a much nicer design, it works faster then the old design and even includes traditional Windows apps. This is the biggest change to the store since it's introduction in Windows 10 and with their new revenue share policies, allowing developers to keep all of the money their app makes as long as they bring their own payment platform, it should start to put pressure on Apple and Google to start doing the same. Especially as it now sets a precedent for companies allowing developers to use their own payment platforms and keep all of their revenue.

The new design of the Microsoft Store is much cleaner and much simpler to navigate. The application categories have been moved over to the left hand side of the screen and the search bar has been expanded across the top. This allows users to easily access search in the store without the user having to wait for the old search bar to expand.

## The new Settings application

The settings application in Windows 11 has been completely redesigned with what appears to be a simpler, easier to use design that fits better with the design theme of Windows 11.

The categories for settings are now on the left hand side of the application, when a category is selected the right side of the application then shows an overview of the settings that are available in that category. This allows users to see how their PC is working at a glance in a simple overview.

## The new file explorer

The file explorer has also been redesigned with a new, more modern user interface that brings the explorer more inline with design ideas introduced later during Windows 10 and allow to easily fit in with the rest of the Windows 11 interface.

There are also new context menus in file explorer that app developers will be able to interface with directly, allowing them to offer options to users directly from the file explorer.

## Notification Centre and Quick settings

The Notification Centre and Quick Settings areas have also been redesigned to make them more modern and easier to use with touch without compromising the keyboard and mouse experience.

The Notification Center shows notifications and a calendar view while the Quick Settings area shows common PC Settings such as Volume, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. Above the quick Settings area there is a new media controls area which allows users to control media playback through Edge or other applications.
