I've been using the Galaxy Watch4 for over a month now and I have to say, it's the best smartwatch that I've used since I got my first smartwatch in 2017. Let's get into what makes this the best watch I've used in the last 4 years.

The new Galaxy Watch4 is probably the best smartwatch available for anyone in the android ecosystem at this point in time. It's the first, and currently only, smartwatch running Wear OS 3 from Google. It has advanced features such as body composition monitoring, a sleek and minimal design, and also access to every application in both the Google Play Store and also the Galaxy Store.

It's the access to both google play and galaxy store apps that I think will allow this watch to succeed, this allows users to access more apps than ever before and also means that developers no longer need to maintain multiple codebases to support wearables on Android as all devices, with a few exceptions, now run on Wear OS. This also means that people can swap to a different android phone without losing access to the applications they rely on. However, the new platform is not compatible with iOS which may be a deal breaker for some.
