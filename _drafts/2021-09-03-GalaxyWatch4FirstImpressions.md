## Design and Comfort

## Wear OS powered by Samsung

Samsung have partnered with Google to create a new version of Wear OS that can run on all smartwatches. The new OS is a combination between Tizen OS and Wear OS which allows for much better battery life and health sensing.

### Play Store
---------------

The new Galaxy Watch4 comes with the Play Store instead of the Galaxy Store which was seen on previous devices in the Galaxy Watch line. The Play Store uses the same Google Account that the user has on their phone, this integration with google also means that when an app is downloaded on the users phone which has a companion app for wear os it will be downloaded on the watch automatically which will allow users to save time in regards to downloading companion apps on their watch.

### Missing Features
---------------

The Google Assistant is currently unavailable on the Samsung galaxy Watch4, this is a major feature in the Wear OS platform and it's strange to see it missing from the Galaxy Watch4. Instead of the Google Assistant, Samsung's latest watch comes with Bixby which is a good enough alternative but as no where near as many features as the Google Assistant.

Samsung did provide a statement to [Android Authority](https://link) saying that the Google Assistant would come to the Galaxy Watch4 at some point but they didn't say when it would be released.
