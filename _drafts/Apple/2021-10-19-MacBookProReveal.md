Apple has announced the newest versions of their Macbook Pro laptops with a new design, processor, and ports. Let's get into all of the new details and how these new Macbooks show Apple is finally listening to their customers after years of ignoring what they wanted.

# Processors

Apple announced two new processors on Monday, the M1 Pro and the M1 Max, these processors are the first major evolution of Apple Silicon since their introduction in 2020. 

The M1 Pro is the lower-powered version of the two processors and it comes with up to 32GB of unified memory and up to 10 CPU cores with an incredible 16 core GPU. This supposedly allows for 2x faster graphics performance than M1 with a 70% increase in CPU speed as well. 

The M1 Max is the more powerful version of the two processors with the same 10-core CPU as the M1 Pro but it makes up for this with a beastly 32-core GPU allowing for 4x faster graphics performance than the standard M1. The M1 Max also supports up to 64GB of memory allowing people to run multiple tasks at the same time with ease.

This is a massive increase over the previous M1 processor and also shows that consumers can expect similar jumps in performance between generations of Apple Silicon as they have come to expect with the jumps between Apple A-series processors that power the company's iPhones and iPads.
